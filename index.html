<img src="Project euler so far.png" width="600" height="300">
<p> I have been doing project euler from the start of September 2025, with this being my progress so far</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have also done golf as part of a school ECA. I have an interest in golf and have played in competitions such as the BSSL Sports League. This shows my competitive nature in doing things and playing golf for around 5 years shows my patience and determination as golf can be a frustrating sport to play at times.</p>
<p>I have also played the guitar till Grade 8 and I did this for 5 years(from 2019-2024). This also further shows my determination to do well and try my best in things.</p>
<p>I am also currently finishing off my Silver Duke of Edinburugh Award and have also completed my Bronze Duke of Ediburugh Award. </p>

<p>I have done 12 GCSES, getting 4 Grade 9s, 3 Grade 7s and 5 Grade 8s.<br> I have done the UKMT Junior and Intermediate Challenges, getting Silver in the Intermediate challenge.</p>
