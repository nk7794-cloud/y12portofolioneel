<p> This is my project euler so far</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have also done golf as part of a school ECA. I have an interest in golf and have played in competitions such as the BSSL Sports League. This shows my competitive nature in doing things and playing golf for around 5 years shows my patience and determination as golf can be a frustrating sport to play at times.</p>
